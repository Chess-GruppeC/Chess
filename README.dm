Chessify is like any chess game
- a game played between two opponents on opposite sides of 
a board containing 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player has 
16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights and 8 pawns. 
The aim of the game is to checkmate the other king. 
But with a special function: You have a special-move-bar(SMB) which fills up, when
defet enemy pieces. If SMB is full you can use a special ability for one turn. 

Special abilitys could be atomic, horde ... etc.
